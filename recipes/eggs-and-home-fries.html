                <h4>Pan or air fry your potatoes:</h4>
                <p><b>In a pan: </b>Put cooking oil or butter in a pan. Heat the oil on medium heat until it becomes more runny. Chop up your potato into little cubes, then place them in the pan. Be careful not to burn yourself! Cook until golden brown on both sides.</p>
                <p><b>In an air fryer: </b>Preheat the air fryer to 350 degrees farenheit. While the air fryer preheats, chop up the potato into little cubes. When the air fryer reaches 350 degrees farenheit, put in the potato and drizzle some cooking oil over it. Let cook for 12-15 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Cook your eggs</h4>
                <p><b>Optional: </b>Put cooking oil in the pan. Heat the oil until on medium heat until it becomes more runny. Add panchetta to the pan, cook until brown and crispy. Add spinach, cook until shriveled.</p>
                <p>If you decided to cook an omelet, scramble the eggs in a bowl before pouring over cooked omelet ingredients. If not, cook your egg to your liking. If you want cheese, sprinkle or place it on top of your egg when it's almost fully cooked.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Toast your bread</h4>
                <p>While your eggs are cooking put your toast in a toaster.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Fry your bacon</h4>
                <p>Heat some more cooking oil in a pan, then add the bacon once the oil is runny. Cook until crispy, then lay aside on a paper napkin to absorb the excess cooking oil.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Enjoy!</h4>
